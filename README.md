# app icons

Hand-made circle icons for a small selection of Android apps.

## the icons

<img src="png/port_authority.png" width=256 title="Port Authority" /><img src="png/privacy.com.png" width=256 title="Privacy.com" /><img src="png/taco_bell.png" width=256 title="Taco Bell" />

## why?

I like my app icons to all be circular in the app drawer. Sometimes they don't have circular/adaptive icons or sometimes it just looks ugly.
